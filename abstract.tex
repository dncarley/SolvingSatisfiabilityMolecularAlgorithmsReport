Molecular computation uses techniques from molecular biology and combinatorial chemistry to perform computation.  We explore, via simulation, three distinct molecular algorithms for solving {\sc Satisfiability}.  The simulation measures the number of molecular operations each algorithm needs to solve {\sc Satisfiability}. The test input consists of a set of random $3$-{\sc Sat} instances distributed over a range of clause-variable ratios ($\alpha = [0.2, 14.0]$).
