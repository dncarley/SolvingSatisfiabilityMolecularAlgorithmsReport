\section{Distribution algorithm for {\sc Satisfiability}}

%	<Paragraph> Introduce Distribution algorithm	
The distribution algorithm parses an input CNF expression into growing and self regulated set of possible combinations.  A possible combination begins with all members of the first clause.  Variables get inserted into an expanding set of valid assignments.  A clause gets eliminated when an assignment contains a conflict.
	\subsection{Description of the Distribution algorithm}
		
%		<Paragraph> Describe preconditions	
%		<Paragraph> Describe setup
		
Initially the algorithm starts with the variable assignments of a clause.  Evaluation of subsequent clauses extends the solution space with the {\sc Insert Variable} subroutine.  During each insertion, the variable gets inserted into a potential solution vector.  Table \ref{distributionInsertTable} lists the four possibilities for variable assignment.

\hline
Item & Return state & State \\ \hline 
1	& $v \cdot s$ & if $v$ is less than all elements in $s$ \\ 
& &  \\ \hline
2	& $s \cdot v$ & if $v$ is greater than all elements in $s$ \\ 
& &  \\ \hline
3	& $s_1 \cdot v \cdot s_2$ & if $v$ is between two elements in $s$ \\ 
& &  \\ \hline
4	& $\emptyset$ & if $v$ conflicts with $-v$ in $s$\\ \hline

%		<Paragraph> Describe execution
		
During this phase, each variable from a disjunctive clause gets considered, incrementally constructing a partial solution space.  Items (1), (2) and (3) place a variable $v$ into an existing sequence $s$.  Each of these cases represents when the variable $v$ get inserted in a non-decreasing sequence.

A variable conflict occurs when both positive and negative assignments of a variable occur in a sequence $s$.  In this case, the sequence $s$ gets removed from the set potential solutions.

Redundant vectors get removed after insertion of the next disjunctive clause.  Any remaining valuations in the solution space contain non-conflicting variable assignments.  This does not immediately require that each valuation be a complete satisfiable assignment. Satisfiable valuations remain in a non-empty satisfying solution space.
		
		

%		<Paragraph> Describe Output



Vectors that are of equal magnitude of the number of variables in the problem instance are satisfiable valuations.  However, there may exist solutions that span only the required satisfiable assignments; that is activate each of the independent clauses with at least one non-conflicting assignment.  This assignment may be the minimum valuation for the expression, in the case that the backbone consists of the variables of the maximum valuation.
